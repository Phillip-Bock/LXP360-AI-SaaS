# LXP360-SaaS Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed
None - all files are currently in use or serve a specific purpose.

## Navigation Links Fixed

### Updated Links in Public Header
- Added `/dashboard` link for authenticated users
- All existing links verified and working

### Updated Links in Public Footer
- All footer links verified
- Social media links placeholder (to be updated with actual URLs)

## Role-Based Dashboard System

### New Files Created
1. `lib/rbac/get-user-role.ts` - Helper functions to get user roles
2. `components/dashboards/admin-dashboard.tsx` - Admin view
3. `components/dashboards/instructor-dashboard.tsx` - Instructor/Designer view
4. `components/dashboards/learner-dashboard.tsx` - Learner view
5. `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dynamic dashboard that renders based on role

### How It Works
- When a user logs in and navigates to `/dashboard`, the system checks their role
- Based on their primary role (admin > manager > instructor > learner), it shows:
  - **Admin/Manager**: Full system access - user management, course management, RBAC, analytics, media assets
  - **Instructor**: Course creation and management, student tracking, analytics, media library
  - **Learner**: Course browsing, progress tracking, certificates, schedule

### Role Priority
If a user has multiple roles, the system uses this priority:
1. Admin (highest)
2. Manager
3. Instructor
4. Learner (default)

## Missing Pages Identified (from SITEMAP.md)
These pages are linked but don't exist yet:
1. `/contact` - Contact form page (HIGH PRIORITY - linked from multiple pages)
2. `/about` - About LXD360 page
3. `/services` - Services overview page
4. `/courses` - Public courses listing
5. `/blog` - Blog listing page

## Recommendations
1. Create the missing pages listed above (especially `/contact`)
2. Update social media links in footer when available
3. Consider adding a user profile page
4. Add logout functionality to the dashboard
