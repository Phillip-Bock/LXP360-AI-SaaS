## Dependencies Added

- `@sanity/image-url`: For Sanity image URL generation

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **User Authentication**: Integrate with Supabase auth to track actual users
2. **Permissions**: Add RBAC to control who can upload/edit/delete assets
3. **Bulk Operations**: Add ability to select and operate on multiple assets
4. **Advanced Filters**: Add filters by asset type, status, date range
5. **Asset Collections**: Group related assets into collections
6. **Usage Tracking**: Show where assets are used in courses/lessons
7. **Thumbnail Generation**: Auto-generate thumbnails for videos
8. **CDN Integration**: Optimize asset delivery with CDN

### Known Limitations
1. Lock system uses placeholder user reference ("current-user")
2. No actual user authentication integration yet
3. No permission checks on upload/edit operations
4. No asset deletion functionality
5. No bulk upload support

## Troubleshooting

### Assets not loading
- Check Sanity environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Sanity dataset has the `mediaAsset` schema deployed
- Check browser console for errors

### Upload failing
- Verify file size is within Sanity limits (default 200MB)
- Check Sanity write token has correct permissions
- Ensure API route is accessible

### Preview not working
- For videos: Check `react-player` supports the format
- For 3D models: Browser may not support inline preview
- Check file URL is accessible
