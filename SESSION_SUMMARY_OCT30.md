## 💪 WHAT WE LEARNED

### **Monorepo Benefits:**
- Clean separation of apps (platform, authoring, LMS, marketing)
- Shared packages for common code
- Independent deployment per service
- Better scalability

### **Dashboard Strategy:**
- Simple dashboards first (functional, not feature-rich)
- Add role-specific features incrementally
- Focus on getting RBAC working end-to-end
- Polish later based on user feedback

### **Dev Workflow:**
- Dev role selector enables rapid testing
- LocalStorage persists role selection
- Development-only features (doesn't appear in production)
- Faster iteration on role-based features
