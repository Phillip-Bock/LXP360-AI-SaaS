2. Onboarding new team members or AI agents
3. Maintaining consistency in design and architecture
4. Tracking progress and decisions over time
5. Quick reference for branding, structure, and RBAC rules

## Best Practices

1. **Keep docs updated**: Update relevant docs when making significant changes
2. **Reference in code**: Link to these docs in code comments when implementing features
3. **Session summaries**: Add session summaries to Migration-Logs after major work
4. **Version control**: All docs are version controlled - commit meaningful changes
5. **Living documentation**: These docs should evolve with the project
