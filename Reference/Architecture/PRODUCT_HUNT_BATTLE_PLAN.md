## üí™ THE REALITY:

**You have me 24/7 for the next 3 weeks.**

Let's build something investors can't ignore.

**Ready? Let's start with testing the platform RIGHT NOW.**

```bash
cd G:\GitHub\LXP360-SaaS\LXP360-AI-SaaS
pnpm install
pnpm --filter lxp360-platform dev
```

**Run that and tell me what happens. Let's see what we're working with.** üöÄ
